# 对设计的反思

One of the most interesting things designers desire to do is **innovating**.   
Tan introduces the relation between **creation** and **innovation**, especially the role of engineers play in the innovating progress.

Tan stressed that design **includes** rather than **eqauls to** art. A good design should have satisfying outlooking(in other words, good aesthetics), but uses **designerly way of thinking** in developing designs.
